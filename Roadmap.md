# Framework Tracker Roadmap

Our current Roadmap stems from our initial comparison list which we created at the start of the project to define the scope and direction of our work. This list is not set in stone but it gives a good overview of the frameworks we're tracking and the metrics we're measuring [initial-comparison-list.md](./initial-comparison-list.md).

To make it clearer on what we are actively working on here is a breakdown of our what we are doing right now. This list is not exhaustive but it gives a good overview of the areas we are focused on right now. 

## Current Focus Areas

- **SPA**: Adding a SPA test and metrics for each metaframework.
- **In the Wild Data**: Pull in real world data for each framework from the HTTP Archive
- **Bundle Analysis**: Scanning and checking output of each metaframework looking for things like use of modern web APIS and redundant dependencies or pollyfills.

## Future Focus Areas

- **Improve HTTP Archive Data**: Enhance the quality and accuracy of data by improving metaframework detection and filtering techniques.
